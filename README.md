## what is this
A simple bullet hell game made in GameMaker Studio 2 for LD49.
Included above is the assets folder and the compressed project ("LD49.yyz"). I've never used GitHub before but I assume that's a correct way to share source code (?).

## what is it about
There's an angry radioactive sphere next to you which explodes when its mass decreases too quickly, but also becomes more unstable the higher its mass. It consistently loses mass by throwing hazardous electrons at you.

To prevent the sphere from collapsing and exploding, you need to give it some protons. Conveniently, there's some nearby atoms you steal protons from, if you can defend yourself.

If you're in trouble you can always hit the panic button on the bottom right corner, it clears the screen of any threat with a cooldown of 20 seconds.
